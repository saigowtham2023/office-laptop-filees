personal website

personal website file path - "C:\Users\s-g.tammineni\personal website"

step 1 

created a file and initialized empty git repository in git
challenges faced - 
  while trying to open the directory named "personal website" using cd in git bash.
  wrong command - cd personal website     
  error         - too many arguments
  write command - cd "personal website"
  reason        - while trying to enter directory names having space we should use "" so that git            	          
		  knows it is a single argument.
